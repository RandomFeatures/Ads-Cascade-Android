# Ads-Cascade-Android
Mobile library I use to determine which ad provider to use in my mobile apps.

Ad providers like AdIQuity, AdMob, and MobFox all have different strengths and weaknesses. AdMob does very well in North America, but has a very low click rate in China. MobFox on the other had does well through out Asia. So based on the location and which of my apps this library is being used in, it decides which ad provider to use. A certain percent of the ads are for my games specifically. It also will show my ads if there is no network connection.
